This is the project repository for a P6-style Out-of-Order RISC-V processor as part of Columbia University's CSEE W4824: Computer Architecture course for Spring 2025. This processor was designed by Mateo Nery, Diwa Bhusal, William Wang, and Kuan Zhang.

Currently, our main working branch is dcache_mult, which is largely working for most test programs. The other version submitted as the final coding assignment for the course is under the synthesis branch. 

Some of the current working advanced features we have include a unified Load-Store Queue, and an advanced D-Cache. Additionally, our team worked on advanced cache and branch prediction features that are still in progress. 

We hope to in the future finish some attempted features with advanced caching and branch prediction, as well as make our processor 2-Way Superscalar.

To read the final report for our project, please check out the CSEE_4824_Final_Report_Cache_Course.pdf in our dcache_mult branch.
